# Michael Carey's collection of projects

This repository contains a collection of projects that I have created that show understanding of coding skills.
These projects are intended to be functional and demonstrate understanding in the concept area highlighted but are not intended to be inclusive of a fully functional product. These are proof of concept and skills expos√© coding projects.

These were written early when I was still learning programming from my early teens to my early twenties representing time approx. from 1990 to 1999.
